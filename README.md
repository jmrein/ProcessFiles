This library provides an ultra-simple way of writing a simple UI application which takes an input file, does some processing on it, and writes the output to another file.

This library provides:

* A basic UI
* A progress bar
* Error handling
* File/folder open options once the file is created.

All you need to do is write the conversion function! 

##How to use##
1. Create a Windows Forms project
2. Install the NuGet package
3. Set up the options
4. Write a processing function, and optionally, an on-failure-cleanup function.

And that's it!
See the Demo application for a basic example.
